The code for this assignment was written in python, using mainly numpy, pandas and scikit-learn
The experiments were run in jupyter notebooks
Prerequisites : 
 - python environment (i suggest anaconda)
 - libraries mentioned in requirments.txt (run pip install -r requirments.txt)

Part I - Seperate Analysis Code:

The experiments for Part I were done in three seperate directories. The experiments for each model were done in their own respective directory.
For example - all the decision tree experiments were done in the "decision-tree" directory.
Each directory has 2-3 jupyter notebooks, each notebook has a unique experiment with respect to the model. For example, "random-forest/trees.ipynb" 
contains the experiment where everything but n_estimators is fixed. 
Each directory also has a "results" subdirectory, where all the plots and errors are saved.

Part II - Comparative Analysis Code:

The code for this part is in the directory "comparison".
"compare.ipynb" contains the experiment done for this part. 
The custom implementation of k-fold cross-validation is done in the "k_fold.py" file.
